Introduction: 

This is a simple Python application that uses a Joke API to generate jokes.

Getting Started:

To get started please make sure you have docker installed if you want to run the included Dockerfile. Otherwise, here are some basic steps to get started. 

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python joke_machine.py -n 3

With Docker

1. docker build -t joke_machine .   
2. docker run joke_machine

Assignment: 

The objective of this assignment is to create a suite of unit tests and a suite of component tests that showcases your thought process towards testing an application. Attempt to mock out any dependencies to external resources if possible.

1. Create a suite of unit tests that test these functions: 
    get_joke_api()
    get_joke_type()
    get_joke()
    joke_machine_runner()

2. Create a suite of component tests that test the application as a whole. Think of edge cases an end user might attempt. 

Pre-existing Bugs/Issues:

This program is not perfect by any means. Any bugs you find do not need to be fixed. If you do encounter bugs, record them in a readme. 

Submission: 

Include a readme explaining the unit tests and component tests, as well as how to run them. There are empty folders to place the respective tests into.
